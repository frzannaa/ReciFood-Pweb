              <h1 class="mb-5">Organic Food & Farming Report Outlines Opportunities for the Farm Bill</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter"></span>A new report details the benefits of organic farming and outlines strategies to expand organic agriculture practices through the 2023 Farm Bill. The report is a product of the National Resources and Defense Council (NRDC), Swette Center for Sustainable Food Systems at Arizona State University (ASU) and Californians for Pesticide Reform (CPR).</p>

              <figure class="my-4"> 
                <img src="assets/img/news1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
               
              </figure>
              <p>Entitled “Grow Organic: The Climate, Health, and Economic Case for Expanding Organic Agriculture,” the report uplifts organic agriculture for its focus on ecological diversity, soil fertility, and natural systems over chemical interventions. The authors write that this approach “holds significant and largely untapped potential to address multiple crises facing our society, including climate change, health, and struggling rural economies.”</p>
              <p>Research into the human and environmental benefits of organic agriculture, complemented by case studies of over a dozen farms, helps to highlight the potential of these farming practices. The report shows that organic farming can help to sequester carbon, boost soil health, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These techniques can also help to limit the spread of antibiotic resistance—a growing problem threatening human health—and reduce exposure to harmful agricultural chemicals.</p>
              <p>“Expanding organic agriculture is an investment in our future, one that could ultimately produce significant returns. Today’s conventional system contains immense hidden costs subsidized by our tax dollars that we can no longer afford. When we account for the true costs of our current farming systems—including health, environmental, social, and economic impacts—the value of organic farming is undeniable,” says Dr. Kathleen Merrigan, Executive Director, Swette Center at Arizona State University and former U.S. Deputy Secretary and Chief Operating Officer of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).</p>
              <p>But “Grow Organic” notes that only 1 percent of agricultural land is managed organically. A report from the Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) finds that producers often struggle with challenges including a reduction in yields during the three-year period required for the transition to organic, weed and pest management, and organic certification costs. OFRF also notes that these challenges disproportionately affect BIPOC growers.</p>
              <p>To change this, the authors of “Grow Organic” provide 10 recommendations to help policymakers scale organic agriculture through the 2023 Farm Bill and beyond.</p>
              <p>“More significant organic investments in the Farm Bill— together with a strong administrative commitment to organic and the continued advocacy of stakeholders—are necessary to ensure that everyone who wants to farm, ranch, manage land, and eat organically can do so,” the report states.</p>
              <p>Suggestions include providing greater support to farmers during the transition period, increasing federal resources to support research into and technical assistance for organic agriculture, and reducing barriers to organic certification for BIPOC farmers. Using True Cost Accounting can also help stakeholders better understand the value of organic agriculture.</p>
              <p>“The cash register receipt captures only part of the true cost of food,” Merrigan tells Food Tank. “The harm of synthetic chemicals on human health, biodiversity, and the environment are not accounted for, which is one of the many reasons why organic is always a best buy.”</p>
              <p>The authors also call for greater consumer education around organic foods and better integration of organic programs into public institutions such as the USDA.</p>
              <p>“It’s time to unlock the potential of organic agriculture through our public policies, including the upcoming Farm Bill,” says Allison Johnson, Senior Attorney at NRDC. “Taxpayers are spending billions every year to prop up conventional farming practices that put people and the environment in danger. Investing in the transition to organic means climate-resilient farming, healthier food options, and more robust local economies.” </p>

                <h1 class="mb-5">WORLD VEGAN DAY AND THE RISE OF PLANT-BASED EATING</h1>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter"></span>Established in 1994 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Vegan Society in the UK – and the simultaneous coining of the word ‘vegan’ – World Vegan Day is now celebrated around the world.</p>
  
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/news2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
               
              </figure>
              <p>A contraction of the word ‘vegetarianism’, veganism extends the millennia-old practice of vegetarianism into a stricter approach in which the consumption of all animal-based products – not just meat – is avoided as far as practically possible. For most vegans, this extends to avoiding honey and not consuming drinks treated with animal-based products. (Wine and cool drinks, for example, are often clarified with animal-based products such as gelatin or isinglass, a substance obtained from the dried swim bladders of fish.)</p>
              <p>TIME FOR FEASTING AND CELEBRATION</p>
              <p>Speaking in 2011, Louise Wallis, who founded the global day when she was Chair of the Vegan Society, said, “We knew the society had been founded in November 1944 but didn’t know the exact date, so I decided to go for 1 November, partly because I liked the idea of this date coinciding with Samhain/Halloween and the Day of the Dead – traditional times for feasting and celebration, both apt and auspicious.”1
                Also called International Vegan Day in some countries, the day is celebrated in continuity with Vegetarian Awareness Month, which begins with World Vegetarian Day on 1 October, and includes other commemorative dates involving food security, faith-based vegetarianism, and animal advocacy. World Vegan Day is also the first day of World Vegan Month, which runs for all of November.</p>
              <p>THE IMPACT OF VEGANISM ON MAINSTREAM EATING</p>
              <p> Since the first iteration of World Vegan Day, veganism has spread around the world, particularly with the advent of the internet. While those who identify as strictly vegan remain a very small percentage of the global population (about 1% in most countries although the figures are much higher for Generation Z), veganism and plant-based living have impacted substantially on mainstream eating patterns, seen most visibly in the rapid rise of flexitarianism around the world. (It is also a sign of the maturation of the vegan community that vegans now often embrace the concept of flexitarianism despite the fact that it runs counter to their own belief system.)
                With this increase in general interest in plant-based eating has come a parade of plant-based food events throughout the year, from Veganuary to Meat-free Mondays, along with the widespread availability of plant-based foods in supermarkets around the world and an explosion of vegan restaurants. But while veganism has mainstreamed as a concept over the last decade or so, there is still a long way to go, with the urgent challenge to shift the global population towards plant-based eating made more difficult by increasing levels of meat consumption as income levels rise in the Global South. </p>
          <p>EVERY MEAL MAKES A DIFFERENCE</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, there is much to celebrate on World Vegan Day. If plant-based eating continues to grow as it has been doing for the last few years, we’re on the path to a better food system for the planet. But beyond the need for systemic change, every meal makes a difference, and every time we avoid meat or other animal-based products, we also avoid unnecessary death and suffering, while lightening the burden on our bodies and the environment.</p>
          <p>BE PART OF THE CHANGE!</p>
          <p>All contributions to ProVeg go to our campaigns and projects in order to achieve our mission of reducing the global consumption of animals by 50% by 2040.

            As a non-profit organisation, we rely on the generosity of donors like you to stay independent. Your gift will help to fight climate change and create a more sustainable food system.
            
            If you make a new one-time or recurring gift before 31 December, a generous ProVeg donor will double your donation. Take advantage of this opportunity and double your impact today.</p>
